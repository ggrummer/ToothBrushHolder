# ToothBrushHolder
 Mounts on a ceramic buildin toothbrush holder slot and holds a modern wide toothbrush.
 This 3D printed adapter enables modern ergonomic toothbrushes to be mounted onto older ceramic build-in bathroom toothbrush holders.  This adapter fits into some of the narrow slots (of the built-in toothbrush holder), hangs off the side and provides a place to put a newer toothbrush.
 A few decades ago, all toothbrushes had standard size thin rectangular handles.  Bathrooms were designed with places to mount a number of these toothbrushes.  Since these rectangular handles were uncomfortable to hold, eventually they were replaced with wider ergonomic versions.  These newer versions didnâ€™t fit the old holders.  This adapter solves that problem.
